But the vast quantities of things given to us by modern mass production and commerce, the developments of science and the complexities of existence in modern industrialized countries have raised widespread doubts as to the validity of this practice and principle. Our present ‘mental climate’ is not favorable either to a clear understanding of the value of simplicity or to its practice.”</p>",
